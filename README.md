Docker project for IIEC Dokcer training By Vimal Daga
## **NEXTCLOUD : PERSONAL CLOUD**



[**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) is a set of platform as a service products that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.

In this project I deployed a container with [**nextcloud**](https://hub.docker.com/_/nextcloud) server which gives services of personal cloud. A safe home for all your data. Access & share your files, calendars, contacts, mail & more from any device, on your terms.

## **GUIDE:**
**INSTALLING DOCKER**:

This is the official reference to install docker : https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/

I have provided a docker-compose file 'docker-compose.yml'

you can just simply run that file using command 'docker-compose up' 

Do note that you should be in the same working directory where the .yml file is stored

If you are finding difficulty refer : https://docs.docker.com/compose/

If you are willing to do it mannually i attached a 'cmds.txt' file.
